# BetterForgeChat
A Forge based serverside chat mod to allow prefixes, suffixes and integration with LuckPerms and FTB-Essentials nicknames.

### Why does this exist?
If you are building a forge modded server on MC1.18.2 there unfortunately are no decent mods available due to SpongeForge not supporting MC1.18.2 - this mod only supports MC1.18.2 forge servers for this very reason.

***To date this is the most feature-rich chat mod for Forge 1.18.2 blowing all others out of the water***

## Features
### LuckPerms integration

### Permissions plugin integration
Works with any Forge Permissions plugin to provide easy permission management, see the below permissions:
```
- bfcmod.chat.colors
- bfcmod.chat.styles
- commands.color
- commands.colors
```
### Highly configurable
 - Customizable timestamp formats
