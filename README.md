# BetterForgeChat
A Forge based serverside chat mod to allow prefixes, suffixes and integration with LuckPerms and FTB-Essentials nicknames
## This mod is still a WIP, however, if you are building a modded server on MC1.18.2 there unfortunately is no alternatives available due to SpongeForge, Spigot, etc. not supporting MC1.18.2 - this mod only supports MC1.18.2 for this reason

# Installation
- Add JAR file to serverside
- LuckPerms must be installed on server
- FTB Essentials must be installed on server
- Profit!

# Important disclaimer
I have literally built this mod in one afternoon, and it still needs polish however the core code is quite secure and works extremely well, there are some key things however I have not yet implemented:
- Chat color permissions, anyone can use chat colors in chat regardless of status 
- Chat styling permissions, anyone can use chat styles in chat regardless of status 
- Basic mod configuration file
  - No way to enable / disable tab list formatting or nicknames
  - A server might want to disable tab list nicknames to ensure clarity
  - No way to configure chat timestamp
